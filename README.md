# Autonomous Robotics Factory: A Research Platform

Welcome to the official repository for a robotics research project. The goal is to create a fully autonomous factory for materials and robotics research.

### System Architecture
The platform is built on a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** orchestrated by a durable workflow engine.

 * **Internal Communication**: gRPC
 * **Workflow Engine**: Temporal (planned)
 * **MLOps**: DVC for data versioning, MLFlow for experiment tracking
