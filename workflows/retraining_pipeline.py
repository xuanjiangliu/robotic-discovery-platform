# scripts/pipelines/retraining_pipeline.py
#
# Description:
# This script defines the automated retraining pipeline for the EvoFab
# Vision System. It can be triggered by the drift detector to automatically
# retrain, register, and deploy a new version of the segmentation model.
#
# This version uses MLFlow model aliases instead of deprecated stages.
#
# Part of the EvoFab Vision Kit package.
